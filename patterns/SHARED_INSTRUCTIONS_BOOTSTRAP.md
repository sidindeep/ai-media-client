# Shared Instructions Bootstrap

Read root `BOOTSTRAP.md` first when the source provides it. It is the compact,
high-discoverability entrypoint for this full contract.

Use this when a user starts a new project by giving the canonical
shared-instruction Git repository or a local checkout/cache, for example:

```text
Connect shared instructions: https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git
gi init https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git
gi init Dimosfil/general-instructions.git
инит [Dimosfil/general-instructions.git](https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git)
```

Also use this when the user asks to update from a shared instruction library but
the current project does not yet have `tools/project-memory/instruction-kit.json`,
for example:

```text
Обновись из https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git
```

## Meaning

This command means: read the canonical shared instruction source repo, using a
local checkout/cache when needed, and deploy a local instruction kit into the
current project. The source may be the full GitHub URL, the shorter
`Dimosfil/general-instructions.git` repo form, a Markdown link to either form,
or an existing local checkout/cache.

Resolve a Markdown link target before classifying the command. The default
target is the active project root, independently of the source checkout path or
drive. Store the canonical GitHub URL as the update source; store a local path
only as optional cache metadata.

It does not mean:

- add the shared repo or checkout as a dependency
- add it as a package
- add it as a submodule
- create a symlink
- create a runtime reference
- create only a thin `AGENTS.md` that points back to the shared source
- run ordinary `git init`
- replace, add, or reconfigure the current project's git remote

## Required Behavior

1. Resolve the shared source from the command URL, `source_repo` metadata,
   `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`, or an existing checkout/cache. Use
   `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git` as the canonical
   default source repo.
2. Read the shared source's `AGENTS.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and
   relevant templates from the checkout/cache.
3. Create or adapt local project files from templates:
   - root `AGENTS.md`
   - `tools/AGENT_WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md`
   - `tools/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md`
   - `tools/project-memory/README.md`
   - `tools/project-memory/architecture-migrations.md` from
     `templates/ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATIONS.template.md`
   - `tools/project-memory/STUDY_PLAN.md`
   - `tools/project-memory/git-preferences.json`
   - `tools/project-memory/system-preferences.json`
   - optional `tools/project-memory/rag-system.json` from
     `templates/rag-system.template.json` when retrieval may grow into semantic
     RAG
   - optional semantic retrieval evals from
     `templates/semantic-retrieval-evals.template.md` when vector retrieval is
     enabled
   - optional `tools/project-memory/build_chroma_index.py` when local Chroma
     semantic retrieval is enabled
   - `tools/summary/`
   - `tools/agent-start.ps1`
   - `tools/select-project-language.ps1`
   - `tools/select-git-commit-languages.ps1`
   - `tools/select-system-language.ps1`
4. Ask whether the project should connect task-manager plan sync. Offer the
   available adapters from `skills/task-manager-plans/references/managers/` plus
   a `none` option. If the user chooses a manager, copy the
   `task-manager-plans` skill and create
   `tools/project-memory/task-managers.json` from the template.
5. Add agent-memory ignore rules to the local `.gitignore` when appropriate.
6. Keep the local files project-owned and editable.
7. Mention the shared source only as the source used for bootstrapping, not as a
   live dependency.
8. Record the copied baseline in `tools/project-memory/instruction-kit.json`
   with included migrations marked as already applied. Store
   `update_check.source_repo` as
   `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`. Store a local path
   only as optional checkout/cache metadata, not as the canonical source.
9. Stop after setup and ask what the user wants to do next.

For a fresh target, prefer the resolved checkout's deterministic installer:

```powershell
.\tools\install-instruction-kit.ps1 -TargetPath <current-project-root>
```

The installer creates missing files and preserves existing files. If local
instruction files already exist, inspect them and merge missing rules carefully
after the installer reports them as preserved.

## Token Rules

- Do not copy every shared document into the project.
- Use the templates and checklist, not a full dump of the library.
- Do not read `updates/`; it is maintenance-only for `general-instructions`.
- Do not run broad checks, builds, UI inspection, or zip packaging unless the
  user asks.

## If Files Already Exist

If local instruction files already exist:

- preserve project-specific content
- merge missing rules carefully
- avoid overwriting without reading the target file first
- summarize what was created or updated
